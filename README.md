# ðŸ“Š AI-Powered Network & System Monitoring Reports  

This proof-of-concept application ingests one or more system log files and uses the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/) (`gemini-2.5-flash` model) to generate insights covering the most recent 7 days of activity.  

The **goal** is to demonstrate how generative AI can enhance the productivity of network and system administrators by assisting with log analysis, anomaly detection, and incident reporting.

## âš  Important Notice  
This is **only a proof of concept**.  

- Do **not** use sensitive or production system logs unless you are certain your chosen AI provider guarantees that logs will not be retained or reused for training.  
- The sample logs in this repository (`/sample-logs`) are AI-generated. They were created by prompting a model to simulate web server access/error logs, Fail2Ban logs, syslogs, and other system logs relevant to the proposed setup.

## Example Prompt for Generating Sample Logs
```
Imagine a server with hostname group-01-vm that is used to host a WordPress website for an organization called Group01. The VM runs Debian 12 with Apache, and Fail2Ban is enforced for various jails, including Apache jails.

Between August 1â€“19, 2025, the website was inaccessible for 1 hour 32 minutes on August 19 starting at 21:04.

Generate various types of logs (as found under /var/log) covering this period, with entries that could indicate downtime and possible causes.
```

## Concept Overview
### 1. Centralized Monitoring
Servers on the same network can be configured to periodically transfer their logs (e.g., via cron jobs) to a central "head node" running this application. Reports are then generated across all nodes.

### 2. Manual Log Upload

For systems outside the managed network, logs can be manually uploaded into the application for analysis.

### 3. Unified Reporting

Logs from multiple endpoints are summarized into a single AI-generated report, highlighting incidents, anomalies, and security alerts.

# Using the Reporter
## Prerequisites
### 1. `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file
Create a `secrets.toml` file inside a `.streamlit/` folder containing the following details:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "<YOUR API KEY>"
```

Where `<YOUR API KEY>` is a Google AI Studio API key generated from https://aistudio.google.com/. 


### 2. vars.cfg
In `vars.cfg` file, specify the location of the logs and the Gemini model you will be using. Note that the logs should be in this format:

`<hostname>.<logfile>`

The assumption is that when using cron to transfer logs to the head node, a command that would prepend the hostname to the log files is also used.

### 3. Python 3.11 environment
Install the required packages from `requirements.txt` by executing:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. `prompt`
Modify the `prompt` file as needed.

## Deployment
Run the following command:

```
streamlit run ðŸ“Š Network and System Monitoring Reporter.py
```
