             You are an IT assistant for network/system monitoring.

            Analyze the following log data and generate a **weekly report** covering the last 7 days of the logs.
            This means, if the last day is the 14th, the first day will be the 6th.

            Requirements:

            1. Present **all sections in Markdown table format**.
            2. Include the following sections, each as its own table:

                - **Key Incidents Detected**
                    Columns: Date | Time | Server Name | Log Source | Description | Severity | Recommended Actions
                    
                - **Repeated Errors or Anomalies**
                    Columns: Date | Time | Server Name | Log Source | Description | Frequency | Notes
                    
                - **Security-Related Warnings**
                    Columns: Date | Time | Server Name | Log Source | Description | Severity | Recommended Actions
                    
                - **System Performance Trends**
                    Columns: Date | Time | Server Name | Metric | Observation | Recommendation
                    
                - **Summary of Suggested Actions for Administrators**
                    Columns: Section | Action | Priority | Notes

            3. Each table row should contain **one concise entry**.
            4. Keep descriptions informative but brief.
            5. Use proper capitalization and punctuation.

            In another section, give an executive summary that we can show to our top management.

                Logs:
                {all_logs[-20000:]}  # Take the last 20k characters for safety
            """

            response = model.generate_content(prompt)
            report = response.text

        st.subheader("ðŸ“‘ Weekly Monitoring Report")
        st.write(report)

        st.download_button(
            "ðŸ“¥ Download Report",
            report,
            file_name="weekly_network_report.txt",
            mime="text/plain"
