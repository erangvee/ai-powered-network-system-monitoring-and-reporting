            You are an IT assistant for network/system monitoring.

        Analyze the following log data and generate a **weekly report** covering the last 7 days.

        Requirements:

        1. Present **all sections in Markdown table format**.
        2. Include the following sections, each as its own table:

            - **Key Incidents Detected**
                Columns: Date | Time | Server Name | Log Source | Description | Severity | Recommended Actions
                
            - **Repeated Errors or Anomalies**
                Columns: Date | Time | Server Name | Log Source | Description | Frequency | Notes
                
            - **Security-Related Warnings**
                Columns: Date | Time | Server Name | Log Source | Description | Severity | Recommended Actions
                
            - **System Performance Trends**
                Columns: Date | Time | Server Name | Metric | Observation | Recommendation
                
            - **Summary of Suggested Actions for Administrators**
                Columns: Section | Action | Priority | Notes

        3. Each table row should contain **one concise entry**.
        4. Keep descriptions informative but brief.
        5. Use proper capitalization and punctuation.

        In another section, give an executive summary that we can show to our top management.
        Logs:
        {all_logs[-20000:]}  # Take the last 20k characters for safety

            """
    
    with st.spinner(f"Analyzing logs for {hostname}..."):
        response = model.generate_content(prompt)
        report = response.text
    st.session_state["reports"][hostname] = report
